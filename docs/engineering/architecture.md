# Architecture

The product constraints governing provider boundaries are canonical in the
[product pitch](../product/pitch.md).

## Shared presentation topology

`extension/shared` is the neutral presentation source. `token-geometry.js` owns
token validation, strict CSS-color conversion, and percentage geometry;
`primitives.js` owns only the documented St/Clutter primitive inventory; and
`stylesheet.template.css` is the canonical Shell stylesheet contract. Both
JavaScript modules fail closed on invalid presentation input and import no catalog
fixtures or state.

The developer-only GNOME Shell 50.1 catalog remains under
`design/direction-lab`. Its `extension.js` adapts disposable `catalog-state.js`
snapshots and static fixtures into presentation models, composes the shared
primitives, and destroys the prior actor tree on every rerender. Provider marks
remain local attributed assets with unmodified dark- and light-chrome variants.

The packaged token manifest drives runtime drawing and actor geometry. The shared
template generates the catalog's root `stylesheet.css`, which GNOME loads, and the
gate rejects source or generated-file drift. Packaging includes the complete
`shared/` directory and tokens while forbidding stale root shared modules.

The catalog has no provider boundary, credential access, network process, polling,
or durable storage. The gate installs it and a generated, noncanonical temporary
second consumer into separate disposable GNOME devkit sessions.

## Production surface topology

`extension/` is the persistent Shell 50 production package, UUID
`claudex-usage@hugo.local`. It packages the shared primitives, token manifest,
generated stylesheet, and canonical provider marks. `surface-controller.js` is pure
and Node-testable: it validates the provider-slot contract, snapshots presentation
metadata, coalesces refreshes, and emits presentation models. `extension.js` owns
`PanelMenu`, GLib timeout ownership, theme changes, actor composition, and teardown.

The installed extension is provider-free. The J-002 harness registers Claude and
Codex stubs through the real in-process API; neither fixture is present in the ZIP.
One five-minute timer exists only while at least one provider is eligible. A refresh
starts immediately when the first provider becomes eligible, scheduling begins after
completion, and failure or ineligibility clears retained readings before rendering.

The package declares `org.gnome.shell.extensions.claudex-usage` and includes its
GSettings schema, which GNOME compiles on installation. It persists only the three panel-visibility booleans and
the accepted refresh enum; settings changes rerender the panel immediately and
reschedule the single timer without a concurrent refresh. The J-003 harness proves
the values survive two fresh Shell sessions through a disposable keyfile backend.
