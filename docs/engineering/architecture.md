# Architecture

The product constraints governing provider boundaries are canonical in the
[product pitch](../product/pitch.md).

## Shared presentation topology

`extension/shared` is the neutral presentation source. `token-geometry.js` owns
token validation, strict CSS-color conversion, and percentage geometry;
`primitives.js` owns only the documented St/Clutter primitive inventory; and
`stylesheet.template.css` is the canonical Shell stylesheet contract. Both
JavaScript modules fail closed on invalid presentation input and import no catalog
fixtures or state.

The developer-only GNOME Shell 50.1 catalog remains under
`design/direction-lab`. Its `extension.js` adapts disposable `catalog-state.js`
snapshots and static fixtures into presentation models, composes the shared
primitives, and destroys the prior actor tree on every rerender. Provider marks
remain local attributed assets with unmodified dark- and light-chrome variants.

The packaged token manifest drives runtime drawing and actor geometry. The shared
template generates the catalog's root `stylesheet.css`, which GNOME loads, and the
gate rejects source or generated-file drift. Packaging includes the complete
`shared/` directory and tokens while forbidding stale root shared modules.

The catalog has no provider boundary, credential access, network process, polling,
or durable storage. The gate installs it and a generated, noncanonical temporary
second consumer into separate disposable GNOME devkit sessions.

## Production surface topology

`extension/` is the persistent Shell 50 production package, UUID
`claudex-usage@hugo.local`. It packages the shared primitives, token manifest,
generated stylesheet, and canonical provider marks. `surface-controller.js` is pure
and Node-testable: it validates the provider-slot contract, snapshots presentation
metadata, coalesces refreshes, and emits presentation models. `extension.js` owns
`PanelMenu`, GLib timeout ownership, theme changes, actor composition, and teardown.

The installed extension registers built-in Codex and Claude providers through the same
in-process API used by external adapters. J-002 and J-003 use disposable packages whose
built-in providers are ineligible under reserved IDs, so their Claude and Codex stubs
remain isolated; no fixture is present in the canonical ZIP.
One timer at the selected persisted cadence exists only while at least one provider is eligible. A refresh
starts immediately whenever a provider newly becomes eligible: it replaces an idle
cadence timer or coalesces into one follow-up after an in-flight cycle. Each completion
is emitted before a queued successor begins, scheduling starts after the final
completion, and failure or ineligibility clears retained readings before rendering.

The Shell composer owns a separate minute-aligned presentation source only while the
usage popup is open. It reads a fresh immutable controller snapshot and updates the
named footer, reset labels, Time pace marker geometry, and progress accessibility in
place, preserving the focused actor tree and selected history range. Popup close,
Settings, last-provider removal, indicator destruction, and extension teardown remove
the source. This presentation path never calls a provider; the existing cadence timer
remains the sole scheduled refresh path.

`codex-runtime.js` scans numeric `/proc` entries every two seconds for an exact
current-user `codex` command name. While present, each surface refresh opens the
current file-backed Codex auth JSON and sends one cancellable, non-redirecting request
to the accepted usage endpoint. Both input streams are bounded during ingress and
decoded strictly. Absence, malformed data, non-200 status, cancellation, or teardown
reduces to unavailable without logging, persistence, process launch, or retained
source values. J-004 keeps this composition intact while substituting only disposable
endpoint and process-root inputs.

The package declares `org.gnome.shell.extensions.claudex-usage` and includes its
GSettings schema, which GNOME compiles on installation. It persists nine preferences:
three panel-visibility booleans, the refresh enum, the global Used/Left display enum,
the global default-on Time pace boolean, the Every day/Weekdays weekly-pace enum, and
the local-history boolean and range enum. Weekdays compresses exact seven-day provider
windows onto local Monday–Friday time while shorter windows retain elapsed-clock pace.
Display changes map canonical used percentages and selected pace only while composing
the panel, provider cards, progress accessibility, and chart; they neither refresh
providers nor rewrite history. Other settings changes rerender immediately and cadence
changes reschedule the single timer without a concurrent refresh. J-003 proves both
additive defaults and every value across two fresh Shell sessions through a disposable
keyfile backend.

`history-store.js` is a pure sample-store boundary shared by Node and GJS; `history-runtime.js`
loads and persists its serialized form as a durable JSON file under the user data
directory. When local history is enabled, each completed refresh records one bounded
sample per available provider window, and the popup derives the merged trajectory for the
selected range from the store — reusing the shipped `HistoryChart` and
`Legend`. The inline range stepper persists the existing enum and restores focus to the
activated arrow after selection rerenders. J-006 runs a second fresh Shell session
against the first session's history file and proves the persisted chart renders without
an in-process store.
Recording rides the existing refresh, so nothing samples or writes while no
provider is present, and nothing recorded leaves the machine. Distinct refreshes that
complete in the same clock millisecond receive adjacent safe millisecond timestamps so
their ordering survives the store's strict monotonic boundary. J-006 seeds a store,
proves the chart, ordered live samples, keyboard range stepping,
theme and scale states, request/store invariance, and the disable path, and reuses the
J-005 Claude endpoint and process-root inputs.

Every production journey that can enable history receives a disposable history
directory. J-002 keeps history enabled and proves its presentation tick against the
isolated recorded sample; J-003 isolates the persisted-settings restore phase as
well. Neither journey consults or mutates the user's default history path.
