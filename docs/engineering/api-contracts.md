# API Contracts

## Provider slot

The production extension accepts in-process GJS adapters through
`registerProvider(provider)`. Registration returns an idempotent unregister callback.
It snapshots presentation metadata and retains only the three lifecycle callbacks;
the installed package registers no provider itself.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `id`, `order` | Globally unique safe ID and non-negative integer. Providers sort by order, then ID. |
| `label`, `detail` | Required nonempty presentation text. |
| `marks` | Required package-relative `darkPanel`, `lightPanel`, and `popup` paths plus an accessible name. Absolute or traversal paths fail. |
| `windows` | Nonempty, uniquely identified usage windows in declared order. Each has label and a token-backed `dataRole`. |
| `isEligible()` | Returns a strict boolean. |
| `subscribeEligibility(callback)` | Observes strict boolean eligibility values and returns an unsubscribe callback. Invalid observations fail closed as ineligible. |
| `refresh()` | Asynchronously returns one availability result. |

`refresh()` returns either `{status: "unavailable"}` or `{status: "available",
readings}`. Available readings contain exactly one `{id, percent, resetAtMs}` for each
declared window: percentages are finite 0–100 and reset timestamps are non-negative
safe epoch milliseconds. Rejections, exceptions, malformed data, missing or extra
readings, and unavailable results carrying readings all become `unavailable` without
logging or retaining raw error details.

The surface owns registration, eligibility visibility, one shared refresh cycle, and
teardown. Adapters own presence detection and provider access. Provider payloads,
credentials, and errors never cross this presentation contract.

## Codex credential and usage boundary

`extension/codex-contract.js` is a synchronous, framework-free source boundary that
can be imported by Node tests and GJS. It exports:

| Export | Accepted input | Failure result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extractCodexAccessToken(authPayload)` | A parsed object whose `tokens.access_token` is a nonempty opaque string, optionally prefixed by case-insensitive `Bearer` and surrounding whitespace | `null` |
| `mapCodexUsage(payload)` | Exactly one valid seven-day account window in `rate_limit.primary_window` or `secondary_window` | Frozen `{status: "unavailable"}` |

Token extraction reads no top-level or alternate credential field. It removes at
most one bearer prefix and rejects embedded whitespace, non-string values, and
malformed containers. The caller owns auth-file access, the parsed payload, and the
returned ephemeral credential; this boundary never logs, persists, or retains them.

Usage mapping reads only the two account-level `rate_limit` window slots. Exactly one
must have numeric `limit_window_seconds` equal to `604800`, finite numeric
`used_percent` from 0 through 100, and non-negative integer Unix-second `reset_at`.
The seconds are multiplied by 1000 only when the epoch-millisecond result remains a
safe integer. `additional_rate_limits`, identity, plan, credit, promotion, allowance,
limit-state, and relative-reset fields cannot affect the result.

An accepted payload becomes a deeply frozen provider-slot result with one `weekly`
reading. Every call creates new presentation objects and retains no source reference.
CODEX-001 leaves the module out of the installed extension; CODEX-002 is its first
production consumer and owns filesystem access, transport, and provider registration.
