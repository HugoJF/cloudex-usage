# Spec: Usage Surface

## Goal

Ship the production extension shell: a unified panel item and popup that present
whatever eligible providers supply through one provider contract, so live values
have a surface before any adapter exists.

## User Journeys

Neither journey extends J-001: that journey is the developer-facing catalog review
and stays untouched. These are the product's first user journeys, composing the
primitives J-001 validated.

### J-002 — Glance at live usage (creates)

Intent: see current usage windows and reset times while an agent is in use.

Acceptance:

- **J-002.1** The panel item exists only while at least one registered provider
  reports eligible, and composes provider marks with enabled percentages at native
  panel height.
- **J-002.2** The popup groups metrics by provider; each visible window shows its
  percentage, zero-origin bar, and reset time from provider-supplied data.
- **J-002.3** The refresh action requests fresh values and updates the freshness
  text in place.
- **J-002.4** An unavailable provider renders the unavailable treatment with no
  numeric or stale values; other providers stay live.
- **J-002.5** When no provider is eligible, the panel item is removed and no
  polling or timers remain.

### J-003 — Persist panel preferences (creates)

Intent: control which limits the panel shows and how often values refresh.

Acceptance:

- **J-003.1** The gear action opens the settings view inside the same popover.
- **J-003.2** A visibility switch updates the panel immediately without closing
  the popup.
- **J-003.3** The refresh-cadence row presents a fixed enumerated choice set and
  applies the selection without restart.
- **J-003.4** Visibility and cadence choices survive a GNOME Shell restart via the
  storage named in Architecture.

## Surface Map

- Absent panel — no eligible provider: no item, no polling.
- Unified panel item — eligible providers' marks and enabled percentages.
- Usage popup — provider cards, freshness footer with refresh action; no history
  chart.
- Unavailable card state — dimmed textual notice, no values.
- Settings view — back action, three limit-visibility rows, refresh-cadence
  choice row.

## Cross-Journey Acceptance

- The stub provider exists only in the review harness; the installed production
  package registers no provider until an adapter spec ships one.
- No credential, provider payload, or usage value is ever persisted.

## Design

Canonical reference: [Direction D — Selected Blend](../../../design/direction-lab/DIRECTION-BRIEF.md#d--selected-blend).
Deviations, both from [BRIEF-LIVE-USAGE](../briefs/2026-07-16-live-usage.md) scope
decisions: the history chart, legend, and range selector are omitted; the settings
view carries only the visibility rows and the refresh choice.

Primitives composed: `PopoverScaffold`, `PanelIndicator`, `ProviderGroup`,
`ProviderCard`, `UsageMetric`, `ProgressBar`, `IconButton`, `SettingsRow`,
`Switch`, `ChoiceRow`, and `FooterStatus`.

New primitives introduced: none. The unavailable state composes existing
primitives as a stamped direction-lab variant with capture evidence, added within
its build slice.

## Contracts

- API: [API contracts](../../engineering/api-contracts.md) — delta: add the
  provider-slot contract (identity, marks, eligibility signal, usage windows with
  reset times, availability state), authored with `SURF-001`.
- Data: [data model](../../engineering/data-model.md) — delta: persisted panel
  preferences (limit visibility, refresh cadence); nothing else durable.
- Decisions: [decision log](../../engineering/decision-log.md) — cadence value set
  and default, production extension UUID; recorded at implementation.

## Architecture

- A separate production extension source (`extension/`) with its own UUID; the
  direction-lab catalog remains the unchanged developer review vehicle.
- Token manifest, primitives, and pure state modules are shared sources packed
  into both extensions; the existing gate guards drift.
- Providers are in-process GJS adapter modules registered against the surface's
  provider-slot contract; the surface owns lifecycle — registration,
  eligibility-driven visibility, and poll start/stop.
- Panel preferences persist in a GSettings schema owned by the production
  extension.
- Refresh is pull-based while at least one provider is eligible, at the cadence
  from the persisted choice.

## Preserve

- Lifecycle, credential, and fail-closed constraints stay canonical in the
  [pitch](../pitch.md) and bind every surface state.
- The primitive inventory budget: composition only; any new primitive is a
  reviewed design-system change.
- The J-001 catalog remains installable and unchanged.

## Build Slices

- [ ] `SURF-001` — shared-module extraction, production extension shell, provider
  contract with stub provider, glance behavior including unavailable and absent
  states, J-002 journey test.
- [ ] `SURF-002` — settings view with persisted visibility and cadence, J-003
  journey test, capture evidence for the new production states.

## Non-Scope

- History chart, legend, and range selector (brief non-goal).
- Local-history settings row (parked capability).
- Live provider adapters and real eligibility detection (SPEC-CLAUDE-ADAPTER,
  SPEC-CODEX-ADAPTER); the shell trusts the contract's eligibility signal.
- Publishing to extensions.gnome.org.

## Open Questions

None.
