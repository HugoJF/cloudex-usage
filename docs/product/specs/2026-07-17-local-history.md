# Spec: Local Usage History

## Goal

Show each eligible provider's recent usage trajectory in the existing popup, drawn only
from usage samples this machine recorded locally during the opportunistic refresh, and
never transmitted or shared.

## User Journeys

### J-006 — See usage history (creates)

Intent: see how usage has been trending while working with an agent.

Acceptance:

- **J-006.1** While local history is enabled and a provider is eligible, each refresh
  records a durable local sample and the popup shows the merged trajectory for the
  selected range.
- **J-006.2** Changing the range re-renders the chart over the new window from recorded
  samples, without a network request and without discarding history.
- **J-006.3** History and the selected range survive a GNOME Shell restart; no sample is
  recorded while no provider is eligible.
- **J-006.4** Turning local history off stops recording and removes the chart while the
  current-value panel and cards stay live; nothing recorded ever leaves the machine.

## Surface Map

- Usage popup chart — merged multi-provider trajectory, range selector, and legend,
  drawn from recorded samples while local history is on.
- Settings — the local-history toggle and range choice persist across sessions.
- Absent-history state — with local history off or no samples yet, the popup shows
  current values with no chart.

## Cross-Journey Acceptance

- Samples are recorded only during the existing eligible refresh; no sampling or store
  write occurs while no provider is eligible.
- The store is local, bounded, and durable; no sample, timestamp, or series is
  transmitted, shared, or logged.
- The chart composes only existing catalog primitives; series keep the reserved provider
  colors and the zero-origin, continuous rendering.

## Design

Canonical reference: [Direction D — Selected Blend](../../../design/direction-lab/DIRECTION-BRIEF.md#d--selected-blend).
The popup composes the existing `HistoryChart`, `RangeSelector`, and `Legend` and the
settings local-history and range controls. Claude 5-hour keeps its 1 px line and both
weekly series their 2.5 px lines. New primitives: none.

## Contracts

- API: [Provider slot](../../engineering/api-contracts.md#provider-slot) — delta: none;
  history derives from the readings the surface already receives each refresh.
- Data: [Data model](../../engineering/data-model.md) — delta: a durable, bounded
  per-provider sample store plus a local-history boolean and a selected-range enum join
  the persisted preferences. Credentials, raw responses, errors, and reset detail beyond
  a recorded sample still never persist.
- Decisions: [Decision log](../../engineering/decision-log.md) — records the durable
  store mechanism, sample cadence, retention window, range set, and gap handling.

## Architecture

The surface's existing refresh cycle appends a bounded sample per eligible provider
window to a durable local store; the popup derives each range's series from the store and
composes the shipped chart. Recording piggybacks on refresh, so no new timer or
background work exists, and nothing is sampled or written while no provider is eligible.
The store is bounded by retention and is never transmitted. HIST-001 owns the record and
read boundary; the surface continues to own polling, rendering, and provider lifecycle.

## Preserve

- The pitch's opportunistic-visibility, privacy, and fail-closed constraints; no
  background monitoring when no agent is present.
- The surface's one shared refresh cycle and strict provider-slot validation.
- Zero-origin, continuous series and the reserved provider colors from the catalog.
- The installed extension stays free of telemetry and credential or response logging.

## Build Slices

- [x] `HIST-001` — a durable, bounded local sample store: define the record-and-read
  boundary fed by the refresh cycle, its retention and range windows, and gap handling;
  add deterministic tests and record the store-mechanism decision. Medium: one
  sample-to-series boundary invariant, at most 14 files and 750 handwritten lines.
- [ ] `HIST-002` — wire the merged chart, range selector, legend, and the local-history
  and range settings into the production popup behind the store, and prove J-006 through
  the production surface. Medium: one recording-to-presentation invariant, at most 15
  files and 800 handwritten lines.

## Non-Scope

- Sending, syncing, or backing up history off the machine, or retroactive backfill from
  provider APIs or logs.
- Threshold notifications or any alerting on the trend.
- New chart, axis, or range primitives, or provider generalization beyond Claude and
  Codex.

## Open Questions

- HIST-001 must freeze the durable store before HIST-002: the record boundary (a bounded
  per-provider sample ring is the owner's recommended default), the sample cadence
  relative to the refresh cycle, the retention window, the shipped subset of
  `1h`/`6h`/`1d`/`7d`/`30d`, and how sparse or irregular samples render — a visible gap
  versus interpolation — against the catalog's continuous, zero-origin series.
