# GNOME journey captures

These images are deterministic actor-level captures from isolated GNOME Shell 50.1
journeys. J-001 covers the developer-only primitive catalog: its selected Direction D
panel, usage and settings states, range focus/hover, off visibility switch, light
Shell chrome, and 200% panel scaling.

J-002 covers the provider-free production package after harness-only providers are
registered through its public contract: dark panel and popup, refresh focus/hover,
unavailable treatment, light panel, and 200% panel scaling. The production surface's
absent state is asserted by the journey rather than captured.

J-003 covers the same production package's persisted settings: dark settings,
visibility-switch focus/hover, cadence-choice focus/hover, and light settings. It
also proves the selected values in a separate fresh Shell session using a disposable
GSettings keyfile.

J-006 adds the production Left popup: current values and bars are complemented from
canonical used percentages, and asymmetric seeded history proves the chart trajectory
is complemented without rewriting the local sample store.

Regenerate the evidence from an isolated GNOME Shell 50.1 session:

```bash
npm run capture
```

The ordinary `npm test` gate runs the same journey into a temporary directory so
validation does not dirty the worktree.
